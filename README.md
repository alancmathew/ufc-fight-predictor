# UFC Fight Predictor

## Goal

Create a machine learning model that can predict fight results with a higher degree of accuracy than the baseline (50%)

## Metric

The mertric of interest to be optimized is **accuracy**, since classes are balanced and incorrectly predicting either binary outcome would be equally undesirable.

## Data

The data for this project comes from the official UFC website: http://statleaders.ufc.com/en/
